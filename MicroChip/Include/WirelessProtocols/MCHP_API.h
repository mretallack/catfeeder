     *      establish connection(s), all depends on the input parameters.
     *
     * PreCondition:    
     *      Protocol initialization has been done. If only to establish connection with

     *      BYTE Mode - The mode to establish a connection. This parameter is generally valid in

     * Function:
     *      BYTE    MiApp_TransceiverPowerState(BYTE Mode)
     *
     * Summary:
     *      This function put the RF transceiver into different power state. i.e. Put the 
     *      RF transceiver into sleep or wake it up.
     *
     * Description:        
     *      This is the primary user interface functions for the application layer to 
     *      put RF transceiver into sleep or wake it up. This function is only available
     *      to those wireless nodes that may have to disable the transceiver to save 
     *      battery power.
     *
     * PreCondition:    
     *      Protocol initialization has been done. 
     *
     * Parameters: 
     *      BYTE Mode - The mode of power state for the RF transceiver to be set. The possible
     *                  power states are following
     *                  * POWER_STATE_SLEEP     The deep sleep mode for RF transceiver
     *                  * POWER_STATE_WAKEUP    Wake up state, or operating state for RF transceiver
     *                  * POWER_STATE_WAKEUP_DR Put device into wakeup mode and then transmit a 
     *                                          data request to the device's associated device
     *
     * Returns: 
     *      The status of the operation. The following are the possible status
     *      * SUCCESS           Operation successful
     *      * ERR_TRX_FAIL      Transceiver fails to go to sleep or wake up
     *      * ERR_TX_FAIL       Transmission of Data Request command failed. Only available if the
     *                          input mode is POWER_STATE_WAKEUP_DR.
     *      * ERR_RX_FAIL       Failed to receive any response to Data Request command. Only available
     *                          if input mode is POWER_STATE_WAKEUP_DR.
     *      * ERR_INVLAID_INPUT Invalid input mode. 
     *
     * Example:
     *      <code>
     *      // put RF transceiver into sleep
     *      MiApp_TransceiverPowerState(POWER_STATE_SLEEP;
     *
     *      // Put the MCU into sleep
     *      Sleep();    
     *
     *      // wakes up the MCU by WDT, external interrupt or any other means
     *      
     *      // make sure that RF transceiver to wake up and send out Data Request
     *      MiApp_TransceiverPowerState(POWER_STATE_WAKEUP_DR);
     *      </code>
     *
     * Remarks:    
     *      None

     * Summary:

     * Description:        
     *      This is the primary user interface function for the application to do energy

     *
     * Summary:
     *      This function tries to resynchronize the lost connection with 
     *      peers, probably due to channel hopping
     *
     * Description:        
     *      This is the primary user interface function for the application to resynchronize a 
     *      lost connection. For a RFD device that goes to sleep periodically, it may not 
     *      receive the channel hopping command that is sent when it is sleep. The sleeping 
     *      RFD device depends on this function to hop to the channel that the rest of
     *      the PAN has jumped to. This function call is usually triggered by continously 
     *      communication failure with the peers.
     *
     * PreCondition:    
     *      Transceiver has been initialized
     *
     * Parameters:      
     *      DWORD ChannelMap -  The bit map of channels to perform noise scan. The 32-bit
     *                          double word parameter use one bit to represent corresponding
     *                          channels from 0 to 31. For instance, 0x00000003 represent to 
     *                          scan channel 0 and channel 1. 
     *                  
     * Returns: 
     *                  a boolean to indicate if resynchronization of connection is successful
     *
     * Example:
     *      <code>
     *      // Sleeping RFD device resync with its associated device, usually the first peer
     *      // in the connection table
     *      MiApp_ResyncConnection(0, 0xFFFFFFFF);
     *      </code>
     *
     * Remark:          
     *      If operation is successful, the wireless node will be hopped to the channel that
