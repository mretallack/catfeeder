# Introduction

Is byte 3 battery? it seems to change down and appears to be some sort of ADC.

# Raw readings

From another feeder:

A4=164
and reported voltage is 5.254,

From my feeder, measuring the battery voltage:

5.96v = 193

# Predicting

If we assume a linear path,

Using this it will be possible to predict the voltage should be at a given reading.
